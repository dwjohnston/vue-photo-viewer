# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Learn more about the recommended Project Setup and IDE Support in the [Vue Docs TypeScript Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#project-setup).

## Solution notes

The wireframe suggests displaying both the photographer, and the country in the resulting photo display. The country is not one of the fields that is included on the search response, so I've omitted it.


## Solution Architecture

- Styling. Just plain CSS. For a simple demonstration like this, KISS.

- State management. None. 
The complexity of this challenge is in the PhotoSearchInput, and having it throttle the requests. Real world, IMO such a component shouldn't rely on external state management being present anyway. Generally speaking it's better if a component is self-sufficient.

## Process notes/use of AI

I made extensive use of Copilot, which zomg, makes a task like this a lot easier, particularly where it's a framework I have not used with any depth. 

The prompting process resembles the process I would¬†use to code the thing without copilot -  first add the empty components, now get the search input returning something/anything and display it, now get it to make API requests...  you can follow the git commits to get any idea. 

I didn't paste in the exercise and tell it to do the whole thing, though now that I mention it, I'm curious how that would turn out üòÖ. 

Copilot was pretty good. It did get bit lost trying to set up the props for the PhotoDisplay component.
